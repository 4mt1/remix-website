# Remix Website

## Installation

First setup your `.env` file, use `.env.example` to know what to set.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The staging server is always in sync with `main`

```sh
git push origin main
open https://remixdotrunstage.fly.dev
```

Tagged commits are deployed to production:

```sh
npm version major
# [some npm message]
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

Use `major` because this isn't an API and it'll take pointless mental effort to think about if your padding change is a major or patch. Let's send the version tags TO THE MOON ðŸš€ðŸŒ•.

## Content

Content is synced to the SQLite distributed system from the `main` branch. You do not need to deploy a tag in order to add or update content.

```sh
git push origin main
# watch the app instances pull the new content
fly logs -a remixdotrun
```

**Authoring Blog Articles:**

- Put a markdown file in `content/blog/{slug-you-want}.md`
- Follow the conventions found in other blog articles for author/meta
- Push to `main`

When linking to other posts use `[name](article-slug)`, you don't need to do `[name](/blog/article-slug)`

**Changing page content:**

- Edit markdown files in `content/{pages,other}/{file}.md`
- Push to `main`

## CSS Notes

You'll want the tailwind VSCode plugin fer sure, the hints are amazing.

The color scheme has various shades but we also have a special "brand" rule for each of our brand colors so we don't have to know the specific number of that color like this: `<div className="text-pink-brand" />`.

We want to use Tailwind's default classes as much as possible to avoid a large CSS file. A few things you can do to keep the styles shared:

- Avoid changing anything but the theme in `tailwind.config.js`, no special classes, etc.
- Avoid "inline rules" like `color-[#ccc]` as much as possible.
- Silly HTML (like a wrapper div to add padding on a container) is better than one-off css rules.
